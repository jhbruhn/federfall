/// is neither of the two recent ones joins the control as its own button
/// rather than living in a competing dropdown.

/// The month sits UNDER the year rather than beside it, because it narrows the
/// year rather than competing with it — and it disappears entirely for "all
/// time", where a month would name no period at all.
